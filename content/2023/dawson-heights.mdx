[Graeme](https://raeburn.works/) lives in the very famous [Kate Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Macintosh) designed Dawson Heights. He did [Open House](https://programme.openhouse.org.uk/) a while back and I went and it was fun. I noticed them on Twitter asking if anyone wanted to volunteer to open open their flat again, so I suggested it to Graeme and then felt like I should help, so I went down and helped out for the day. I also did a little supercut of all the times it had been on TV and we played it on repeat in his living room. Maude did a good job on welcome duty.
